# cardiac-image-analysis
An app I made using MATLAB App Designer to navigate an MRI study of a human heart.

Features:
- Draw contours on images of the heart to outline different chambers.
- Intuitively navigate different images with grid frame-selector.
- Plot clickable slice lines on heart's chambers.
- 'Movie' button to loop through heart's beating cycle.
- Easily switch between viewing angles with menu sidebar.
